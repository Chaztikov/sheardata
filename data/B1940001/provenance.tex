The streamwise coordinates, local Reynolds numbers, edge velocities, and
curved-fitted friction velocities were taken from table 1 of
\citet{SchultzGrunowF+1940+deu+JOUR}.  \texttt{g3data} was used to extract the
wall shear stress data from figure 6 and the velocity profiles from figure 7 of
\citet{SchultzGrunowF+1940+deu+JOUR}.  The symbls in figure 8 were too
cluttered for this purpose.
