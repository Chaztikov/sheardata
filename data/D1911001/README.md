# 1911, Thomas E. Stanton of the National Physical Laboratory, pipe flow experiment

- When using the data, cite `StantonTE+1911+eng+JOUR+ProcRSocA`
  ([link](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.1911.0050)).

- Units in profile CSV files are cm for the radii and cm/s for the velocities,
  respectively.

- Note that no information about the temperature is given in the paper.
  However, Stanton's 1914 paper lists temperatures between 15 °F and 16.5 °F
  for the experiments with air.  Koo 1932, "Mechanisms of Isothermal and
  Non-Isothermal Flow of Fluids in Pipes" (MIT PhD dissertation), pp. 40-42
  also assumes the air temperature is 59 °F (15 °C) for the smooth wall cases.
  This temperature appears reasonable.
