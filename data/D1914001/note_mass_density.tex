The mass density of this series (the one using pipe S and air as the working
fluid) is \SI{1226}{\kg\m^{-3}} when calculated from the bulk Reynolds number.
This value is far too high for air.  Despite the fact that this series fits the
bulk Reynolds number versus friction factor trend well, there appears to be
some kind of miscalculation in this series that is difficult to locate.
