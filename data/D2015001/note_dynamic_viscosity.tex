The Hybrid code does not output the mean dynamic viscosity.  The mean dynamic
viscosity was approximated by assuming that it is the viscosity evaluated at
the unweighted average temperature.  Eventually, higher-order approximations
using Taylor series will be used to provide a better approximation.
