The Hybrid code does not output the mean dynamic viscosity or the mean speed of
sound.  The mean dynamic viscosity and the mean speed of sound were
approximated by assuming that the mean values were functions of the mean
temperature.  Eventually, higher-order approximations using Taylor series will
be used to improve the accuracy.

This same issue extends to the mean kinematic viscosity, thermal conductivity,
and thermal diffusivity, which are calculated based on this approximate mean
dynamic viscosity.
