The Hybrid code does not output the mean dynamic viscosity.  The mean dynamic
viscosity was approximated by assuming that it is the viscosity evaluated at
the unweighted average temperature.  Eventually, higher-order approximations
using Taylor series will be used to provide a better approximation.

This same issue extends to the mean kinematic viscosity, thermal conductivity,
and thermal diffusivity, which are calculated based on this approximate mean
dynamic viscosity.
