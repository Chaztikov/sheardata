# 1929, Thomas E. Stanton, external flow experiments on cylinders

- When using the data, cite `StantonTE+1929+eng+RPRT`.

- The diameter of cylinder in `globals.csv` is given in centimeters.  The angle
  given in `pressure_coefficients.csv` is given in degrees.

- The results should be symmetrical, so the asymmetry measures the data
  quality.

- The data at 360° disagrees with 0° for the Mach 0.255 case, though this
  appears to be a typo.  The CSV file ignores the 360° data.
