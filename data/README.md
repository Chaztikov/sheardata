Data files for the shear layer data compilation
===============================================


## Directory structure

The data directory has a flat directory structure.

- `data/README.md`

- `data/references.bib`

    - This file should contain all references for the entire project.

- `data/taxonomy.md`

    - A draft taxonomy of flows.  This taxonomy is used as the first letter of
      the case identifiers.

- `data/$(case_identifier)`

    - `README.md`

        - This file should serve as the initial documentation for the case,
          though I am considering migrating to LaTeX files instead.

    - CSV files with tabulated data from the originator or other source.

        - All CSV files MUST contain only data.  Any documentation or
          commentary on the data MUST be in separate files like the directory's
          `README.md` file.
        
        - The first row MUST be a left-aligned header line labeling the
          columns.
        
        - All CSV files SHOULD be as human readable as possible.


## Case identifier (accession number) structure

- (REQUIRED) Flow class (1 letter)

    - See `data/taxonomy.md` for more information.

- (REQUIRED) Year of first publication (4 digits)

- (REQUIRED) Case number (3 digits)

- (OPTIONAL) Series number (2 digits)

- (OPTIONAL) Profile or station number (2 digits)

- (OPTIONAL) Point number (4 digits)

Examples: `B1945001` or `J201901201010123`.

The required portions are sufficient to identify a case.  The optional portions
can identify a series of profiles, an individual profile, or even a single
point in the flow if necessary.  I am considering adding dashes between the
optional fields to make the identifier more readable.
