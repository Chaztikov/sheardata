\chapter{Database tables}

To interact with the database at a low-level (without the Python module), you
must know what each table is and what the text codes mean.  This chapter serves
as a quick reference for the tables and codes.


\section{Measurement techniques}

The database stores measurement techniques in a taxonomy to allow researchers
the option to select entire classes of measurement techniques easily.  For
example, using the taxonomy, it is possible to form SQL queries to find all
wall shear stress measurements without having to specify all of the individual
measurement techniques that such a request encompasses.
