Source directory for the shear layer data compilation
=====================================================

This directory contains the scripts that create the database file itself.


## Compilation instructions

To create the database, type

    make


## Files

- `sheardata.py` is the Python module with many low-level commands to interact
  with the data in the database.

- `create_tables.py` creates an empty database.

- Python scripts that use a study identifier as their filename process the data
  from the `data` directory for that study and insert it into the database.
