# For very accurate comparison the surfaces of the tubes should have been

# However, this only appears to be the case for most of the experiments.  Some
# were conducted using steel pipes.  One experiment using air and all of the

# As a matter of interest the results of a series of observations of the

# To measure the velocity of the current, one of two methods was used according
# to convenience.  By one method the total quantity of fluid passing through
# the pipe in a given time was either weighed directly, or passed through a
# water-meter or a gas-holder, which had been designed for the purpose of the
# experiments and carefully calibrated.  By the other method the velocity at
# the axis of the pipe was estimated by measuring the difference of pressure
# between that in a small Pitot tube facing the current and placed in the axis
# of the pipe and that in a small hole in the wall of the pipe.

# To determine the amount of the surface friction two small holes were made
# in the walls of the experimental portion of the pipe, one at each extremity,
# at a known distance apart, and connected to a tilting manometer.  \ldots  In
# this way the fall of pressure along a given length of the pipe was
# determined, and from the known diameter of the pipe the surface friction per

# The form of the tilting manometer used for the estimation of both the surface
# friction and the axial velocity, is that devised by Dr. A. P. Chattock and
# has been previously described.â   For the purpose of the present paper it is
# sufficient to state that in this manometer a pressure difference of the order
# of 0.003 mm. of water can be detected, which is well within the limits of
# sensitivity required in these experiments.  As the fall of pressure in these
# pipes varied from 0.5 to 150,000 mm. of water, other manometers were required
# for the higher pressures, and for this purpose water or mercury U-tubes were
# used for the intermediate pressures, and the Bourdon pressure gauges for the
# highest pressures.

# The footnote lists two papers that should contain more information about the
# manometers used.

# This contains a table of global parameters listing the measurement techniques
# for different series of measurements.
#
# However, even knowing how the flow rate was measured does not provide enough
# information to quantify the uncertainty on that measurement, since the paper
# does not appear to give any information on that subject.

# The particular oil on which these observations were made had a value of the
# kinematical viscosity at 15.5Â° C. of 36.2, or 3230 times that of water at the
# same temperature.  By heating this to 50Â° C. the kinematical viscosity could
# be reduced to 2.1, but even at this temperature the critical velocity in the
# 10 cm. pipe used for the experiments would have been 525 cm. per second.
