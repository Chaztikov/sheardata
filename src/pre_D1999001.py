# number is given.  The rest of the data is dimensionless profiles.  The trick
# is to manipulate some of the basic equations to be in terms of the bulk
# velocity.

# bulk_reynolds_number    = 4.0 * bulk_velocity_plus * friction_reynolds_number
# fanning_friction_factor = 2.0 * ( bulk_velocity_plus )**(-2.0)
